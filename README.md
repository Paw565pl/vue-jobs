# Vue Jobs

This is a simple web app made with Vue 3 and Vite. It leverages Vue Query for efficient data fetching, Vue Router for seamless navigation, and Tailwind CSS for modern styling. The app uses JSON Server as a mock API to simulate backend operations. I developed this app to help me learn Vue.

### How to run it locally?

Simply run those commands after **cloning the repository**.

```sh
pnpm install
```

```sh
pnpm start
```

That's all! Now simply hit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and enjoy using the app. Server will be running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
